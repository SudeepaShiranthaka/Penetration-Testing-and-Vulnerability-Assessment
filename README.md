# Penetration-Testing-and-Vulnerability-Assessment

This report submitted me for the AIA module of Y3S1 as part of my Cyber Security specialization degree on SLIIT. This report has demonstrated the vulnerabilities and essential recommendations for the target scope domains. Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity under critical, high, medium, low, and informational. And In the exploitation phase, demonstrate the possible attacks that can be carried out by the adversary. An adversary would attempt to access the Domain Controllers to help facilitate network traversal and further compromise the systems.
